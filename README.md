# FreeRTOS-LED-and-RTC-Using-Timers-STM32

To run the application:

1.) Install STM32CubeIDE from [here](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html)<br />
2.) Clone the repo and change to the ```code``` directory<br />
3.) Build and run the project using the IDE

The application was tested on STM32F413ZH Nucleo-144 containing ARM Cortex M4 so I cannot guarantee for other MCUs.

This [Medium Article](https://rohitimandi.medium.com/freertos-led-and-rtc-using-timers-stm32-f975b20d7e63) describes the structure and state diagram of the application.
