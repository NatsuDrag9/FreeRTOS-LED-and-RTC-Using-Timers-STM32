# FreeRTOS-LED-and-RTC-Using-Timers-STM32

This project demonstrates the use of FreeRTOS kernel. The project blinks all the on-board LEDs on STM32NUCLEO-F413ZH, configures and prints the on-board real-time-clock (RTC) based on input provided to the serial terminal. The RTC value printed may vary depending on the MCU board.
